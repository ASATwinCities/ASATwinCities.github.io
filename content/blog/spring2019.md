### "Treatment Allocation Using a Multi-Armed Bandit Approach" Sakshi Arya 

In medical practice, different treatments are available for a certain disease and a doctor decides which treatment to use on a patient. Multi Armed Bandit with Covariates (MABC) is a reinforcement learning approach that learns from and adapts to present and past information to achieve maximum benefit for the patients. With MABC,  the decision maker uses a computer algorithm that can balance the tendency to apply treatments that have done well in the past with the option to try other treatments that might be more beneficial in the future. However, based on their experience, doctors may consider certain patient cases to be special and would want to allot a different treatment than that proposed by the MABC algorithm. Therefore, in this work, we propose to develop a statistically valid system that holistically integrates the adaptive learning by the MABC algorithm with taking into account the doctor’s discretion. Strong consistency for the proposed algorithm is shown to prove that the performance of the algorithm eventually becomes close to the optimal performance.

### "A Catalyst to Comprehend Secondary Teachers' Understanding of Statistical Modeling" Michael Huberty

Statistical modeling has been identified by several countries as part of their mathematics curriculum standards for secondary students. However, many secondary mathematics teachers have minimal preparation for teaching statistical modeling. Simulation-based methods for teaching statistical inference have been touted as effective for helping students develop authentic understanding of statistical modeling and inference. This research used problem-solving interviews designed to explore teachers' understanding of statistical models, through the creation and evaluation of statistical models.  The interviews were conducted with four secondary teachers who were teaching an undergraduate-level simulation-based introductory statistics course (the CATALST curriculum) to secondary students. The results suggest that teachers were able to use the simulation-based methods effectively, yet had several misconceptions that may stem from their non-simulation-based statistics education. This research has implications for the professional development of teachers who plan to teach statistics using simulation-based methods.

### "Analysis of Area Under the Curve for Longitudinally Measured Biomarkers with Missing Data in Randomized Trial Studying Effect of Nicotine Reduction in Biomarker Exposure" Luoxi Shi

A simple approach for analyzing repeatedly measured biomarkers is to calculate summary measures such as the area under the time curve (AUC) for each individual and then compare the average AUC between treatment groups using t-test or linear regression. This simple two-step approach is difficult to implement when there are missing data. Some frequently encountered missing patterns in longitudinal studies include baseline missing, dropout (monotone) missing and intermittent missing. The probability of missing can be completely random (called missing completely at random or MCAR), dependent on the observed data (called missing at random or MAR), or dependent on both the observed and unobserved data (called missing not at random or MNAR). Simple methods for dealing with missing data include the complete case analysis (CCA), last observation carried forward (LOCF) analysis and multiple imputation (MI). A recent simulation study (Bell et al., 2014) has shown that, in the presence of dropout missing, the estimated AUC difference based on the mixed effects model, rather than on the individually calculated AUC measures, only has negligible bias under MCAR and MAR, and can minimize bias under MNAR. However, their model requires a normal assumption on the outcome variable, which is often violated in biomarker data because of the skewness. We propose to use the mixed effects model on log-transformed biomarker outcomes. Statistical inference for the ratio, rather than difference, of AUC between treatment groups will be provided. Our proposed
model can also handle imbalance in the baseline biomarker and various missing patterns. We plan to conduct simulations to investigate the performance of the proposed mixed effects model, relative to the LOCF and MI methods, for data with different patterns of missingness. Finally, we apply the proposed model to a randomized trial studying the effect of nicotine reduction on biomarker exposure of smokers.
